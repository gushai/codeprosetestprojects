/* We want, step by step, to develop our primitive calculator language into a 
 * full-fledged PL. 
 *
 * One important milestone on this way is the ability to deal with names.
 * While our previous language allowed expressions with identifiers in them,
 * it had no _binders_ : Constructs that allow to give meaning to a new name.
 *
 * In this variant of the language, called WAE, we introduce such a binder
 * called `With` with which we can give an expression a name that can be used
 * in the body of the `With` expression. This intuition is captured in the 
 * definition of the `With` case class below, which extends our previous 
 * language. 
 *
 * We study this WAE language to better understand what names mean in 
 * programming languages, and how they can be implemented.
 *
 * Note that we deal with *two* languages here:
 * 
 * 1. This Scala file with Scala code. (The so-called "meta-language")
 * 2. Most of the functions work on programs written in the WAE language. (Or
 *    also called "object-language")
 * 
 * Most of the time, we concentrate on WAE, but sometimes, we also talk about 
 * Scala.
 * 
 * We have not defined a concrete syntax for WAE, but it is a real language 
 * nevertheless. We sometimes use some made-up syntax for examples on the 
 * blackboard or in comments. */

/* Substitution
 * ------------
 * Instead of dealing with identifiers as external entities as in AE, 
 * identifiers can now be defined within the language. This justifies a new 
 * treatment of identifiers. We will explain them in terms of _substitution_, 
 * a notion well-known informally from Gymnasium algebra.
 *
 * The idea is the following: The interpreter transforms the term
 *
 *     with (x = 5) {
 *       x + x
 *     }
 * 
 * into
 *
 *     5 + 5
 * 
 * before proceeding. That is, all occurrences of `x` have been replaced by 5.
 *
 * Note that these two programs -- before and after the substitution -- are 
 * certainly not *equal*: They look quite different. However, they are 
 * *equivalent* in the sense that when evaluated, they will produce the same 
 * number. Such transformations between different but somehow equivalent 
 * programs are an important tool for the study of programs, and of programming 
 * languages.
 *
 * Often, if we know which programs behave identically, we understand better how 
 * programs behave in general. We will see more examples of this in this 
 * lecture.
 *
 * Hence, the implementation of the `With` case of our interpreter should be 
 * something like:
 * 
 *     case With(x, xdef, body) => eval(subst(body,x,Num(eval(xdef))))
 * 
 * utilizing a function `subst` with the following signature:
 * 
 *     subst: (Exp,Symbol,Num) => Exp
 *
 * The type of the third parameter is `Num` instead of `Exp` because it is more 
 * difficult to get substitution correct when arbitrary expressions can be 
 * inserted (accidential name capture problem, more about that later).
 *
 * Since we want to experiment with different versions of substitution, we write 
 * the interpreter in such a way that we can parameterize it with a 
 * substitution function: */
def makeEval(subst: (Exp,Symbol,Num) => Exp): Exp => Int = {
  def eval(e: Exp) : Int = e match {
    case Num(n) => n
    case Id(x) => sys.error("unbound variable: "+x)
    case Add(l,r) => eval(l) + eval(r)
    case Mul(l,r) => eval(l) * eval(r)

    // After evaluation, take the `Int` and wrap it into a `Num`:
    case With(x, xdef, body) => eval(subst(body,x,Num(eval(xdef)))) 
  }
  eval
}


/* > **Definition (Substitution - Take 1):**
 * > To substitute identiﬁer `i` in `e` with expression `v`, replace all 
 * > identiﬁers in `e` that have the name `i` with the expression `v`.
 *
 * Let's try to formalize this definition: */

// val subst1 : (Exp,Symbol,Num) => Exp = (e,i,v) => e match {
//   case Num(n) => e
//   case Id(x) => if (x == i) v else e
//   case Add(l,r) => Add( subst1(l,i,v), subst1(r,i,v))
//   case Mul(l,r) => Mul( subst1(l,i,v), subst1(r,i,v))
//   case With(x,xdef,body) => With( if (x ==i) v else x,
//                                   subst1(xdef,i,v),
//                                   subst1(body,i,v))
// }

/* Unfortunately this does not even type-check! And rightly so, because it might 
 * otherwise turn reasonable programs into programs that are not even 
 * syntactically legal anymore.
 * 
 * Exercise for self-study: Find an expression that would be transformed into 
 * one that is not syntactically legal.
 *
 * To see the reason for this, we need to define some terminology (the word 
 * "instance" here means "occurence"):
 *
 * > **Deﬁnition (Binding Instance):**
 * > A _binding instance_ of an identiﬁer is the instance of the identiﬁer that 
 * > gives it its value. In WAE , the `x` position of a with is the only binding 
 * > instance.
 *
 * > **Deﬁnition (Scope):**
 * > The _scope_ of a binding instance is the region of program text in which 
 * > instances of the identiﬁer refer to the value bound by the binding instance.
 *
 * > **Deﬁnition (Bound Instance):**
 * > An identiﬁer is _bound_ if it is contained within the scope of a binding 
 * > instance of its name.
 *
 * > **Deﬁnition (Free Instance):**
 * > An identiﬁer not contained in the scope of any binding instance of its name 
 * > is said to be _free_.
 *
 * Examples: In WAE, the symbol in `Id('x)` is a bound or free instance, and the
 * symbol in `With('x, …, …)` is a binding instance. The scope of this binding 
 * instance is the third sub-term of `With`.
 *
 * Now the reason can be revealed. Our first attempt failed because we substitue 
 * the identifier occurs in the binding position in the with-expression. This 
 * renders the expression because after substitution illegal the binding 
 * position is occupied by a `Num` but an identifier is expected.
 * 
 * To correct this mistake, we need another take at defining substitution:
 *
 *
 * > **Definition (Substitution - Take 2):**
 * > To substitute identiﬁer `i` in `e` with expression `v`, replace all 
 * > identifiers in `e` which are not binding instances that have the name `i`
 * >  with the expression `v`.
 *
 * Here is the formalization of this second definition: */
val subst2: (Exp,Symbol,Num) => Exp = (e,i,v) => e match {
    case Num(n) => e
    
    // Bound or free instance => substitute if names match
    case Id(x) => if (x == i) v else e
    
    case Add(l,r) => Add( subst2(l,i,v), subst2(r,i,v))
    case Mul(l,r) => Mul( subst2(l,i,v), subst2(r,i,v))
    
    // Binding instance => do not substitute
    case With(x,xdef,body) => With( x,
                                    subst2(xdef,i,v),

val test3 = With('x, 5, Add('x, With('x, 3,'x)))

/* What went wrong here? Our substitution algorithm respected binding instances, 
 * but not their scope.
 * In the sample expression, the with introduces a new scope for the inner `x`. 
 * The scope of the outer `x` is _shadowed_ or _masked_ by the inner binding. 
 * Because substitution doesn’t recognize this possibility, it incorrectly 
 * substitutes the inner `x`. 
 *
 * > **Definition (Substitution - Take 3):**
 * > To substitute identiﬁer `i` in `e` with expression `v`, replace all non-
 * > binding identiﬁers in `e` having the name `i` with the expression `v`,

/* The inner expression should result in an error, because `x` has no value. 
 * Once again, substitution has changed a correct program into an incorrect one!
 *
 * Let’s understand what went wrong. Why didn’t we substitute the inner `x`? 
 * Substitution halts at the `With` since, by deﬁnition, every `With` introduces 
 * a new scope, which we said should delimit further substitution. 
 *
 * But in this example `With` contains an instance of `x`, which we very much 
 * want to be substituted! So the question is, shall we substitute within nested 
 * scopes or not? Actually, the two examples above should reveal that our latest
 * deﬁnition for substitution, which may have seemed sensible at ﬁrst blush, 
 * is too draconian: it rules out substitution within *any* nested scopes.

 * > To substitute identiﬁer `i` in `e` with expression `v`, replace all non-
 * > binding identiﬁers in `e` having the name `i` with the expression `v`, 
 * > except within nested scopes of `i`.
 *
 * Finally, we have a version of substitution that works. A different, more 
 * succint way of phrasing this deﬁnition:
 *
 * > **Deﬁnition (Substitution - Final Take):**
 * > To substitute identiﬁer `i` in `e` with expression `v`, replace all free 
 * > instances of `i` in `e` with `v`.

 * -------
 * In this section we tried to introduce binding of names to our WAE language.

 *
 * 2. Correct implementations of substitution need to handle free, bound,
